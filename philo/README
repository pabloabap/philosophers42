**NOTES**

`EVEN`: Request first right fork. 
`ODD`: In first round waits 1ms and request left fork.
In this way its garanteed that EVEN guests eat first, avoiding deadlocks at 
the beggining.

To avoid philosophers unnecesary innanition deads is important to maintain the
right order of taking forks. For this reason the order of leave the forks 
after eat for all philosophers will be: leave right forks first, then left one.
In this way a ficticcious delay will be generated to garantee the meals order
when the total number of philosopher is an even number.
